Last week I reported to the secretary the numbers who participate in each of the four sports. The digits used overall in the four numbers were different and not zero.\n",

However, he used the four numbers to work out the minimum and the maximum possible numbers playing all four sports. His two answers were two-figure numbers, one being a multiple of the other.\n",
