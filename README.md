# Times-Teasers
Here I save the answers to the Teasers in Jupyter Notebooks
The idea is to calculated the answer to the Sunday Times Teaser with brute force in Python. This is much less satisfying and interesting than doing it by hand (the idea being to whittle down the possibilities to make it tractable), so generally I will have the answer already, or at least have had a good go.
